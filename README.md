---

degressly-downstream tracks downstream requests made by an application under regression testing.
It takes observations of API calls performed by each node(primary, secondary and candidate) and can send data to degressly-comparator for further analysis.

## Quick start

Run degressly-core with:
```mvn spring-boot:run```

### Config flags (VM options)

| Flag                               | Example             | Description                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| diff.publisher.bootstrap-servers   | localhost:9092      | Address of kafka bootstrap servers for integration with degressly-comparator                              |
| diff.publisher.topic-name          | diff_stream         | Kafka topic name for integration with degressly-comparator                                                |
| non-idempotent.proxy.enabled       | false(default)/true | Proxy requests in non-idempotent downstream mode when set to true                                         |
| non-idempotent.wait.timeout        | 1000000(default)    | Time in ms to wait when a request arrives from secondary or candidate before primary                      |
| non-idempotent.wait.retry-interval | 100(default)        | Interval for performing cache lookups when waiting for response of primary request in non-idempotent mode |
| primary.hostname                   | 10.0.0.1            | Hostname of primary instance, used to infer the origin of an http request.                                |
| secondary.hostname                 | 10.0.0.2            | Hostname of secondary instance, used to infer the origin of an http request.                              |
| candidate.hostname                 | 10.0.0.3            | Hostname of candidate instance, used to infer the origin of an http request.                              |

#### Hostname inference
Hostname inference is necessary for determining the source of a request for recording an observation and for caching in case of non-idempotent downstream. 
It can be done by either providing the `primary.hostname`, `secondary.hostname` and `candidate.hostname` values or by adding a `x-degressly-caller` header with the values `PRIMARY`, `SECONDARY` or `CANDIDATE`.

## Modes:
* Idempotent downstream mode:
  * Calls from each instance are proxied to the downstream service and their respective responses returned.

* Non-idempotent downstream mode:
  * To be used when downstream services must be called once and only once.
  * Downstream response from the primary request is stored in cache, and the same is returned for secondary and candidate API calls for the same URL and trace id.

## Limitations
Some work in progress limitations are listed below:

* Since degressly-downstream works as an HTTP Proxy, HTTPS S2S calls are not supported. 
  * This can be worked around by using an LB that performs SSL termination with a trusted self-signed certificate - left as an exercise for the reader ðŸ˜‰
* New API Integrations cannot be tested when operating in non-idempotent since cache will never be loaded.
* `trace-id` headers are a hard requirement from each client.
#### Good first issues for new contributors:
* Lots of cache interface code is synchronized, causing performance impact.
* Data is not sent if one of the downstreams does not call a particular API.
* There should be configurable fallbacks for non-idempotent downstream proxy. 
  * A flag should allow a request to be served from actual downstream instead of cache after x seconds of waiting.
  * A header in the request should be able to override config and force a request to be fetched from downstream even if non-idempotent proxy is enabled.
